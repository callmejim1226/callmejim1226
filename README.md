# Hi there 👋


I'm a Full-stack application software developer who's open to learning web, mobile, desktop, cloud, and even more application software. My development experiences include React web with REST API & database in Express.js & PostgreSQL and Flutter app for Android & iOS in Dart with GCP service.

- 🔭 I’m currently developing a full stack Flutter app in the [WiroArt](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wiroart-inc/) and leading the [NEU LIKELION](https://www.instagram.com/likelion.neu/) community through [LIKELION US](https://us.likelion.net/) class program at Northeastern University.
- 🏫 I concentrate on software development at Northeastern University as a computer science major and pursuing a math minor. I expect to graduate by December 2024 with a BSCS degree. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development (Web 2.0 & 3.0, mobile app) and computer systems
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with product managers and software developers in a company that makes creative software
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Blockchain (Web 3.0) and Cloud product development
- 💬 Ask me about the CS program at Northeastern University and software development work in a start-up
- 📫 How to reach me: [My Personal Webiste](https://callmejim.netlify.app/)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have educational experience in three different cities (Moscow, Toronto, and Boston)

## Me in a software team
- 📈 As a developer with a passion for collaboration and mentorship, I’ve guided 40+ students at NEU through [NER software projects](https://electricracing.northeastern.edu/software/), [LIKELION workshops](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jiminkim1226_starting-from-the-personal-website-workshop-activity-7157950189746470913-CreX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), and CS courses.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 My experience working with 50+ developers across 7+ team projects has shaped me into a highly approachable team player with strong empathy and a deep understanding of team dynamics.
- 👍 In software projects, I'm motivated to ask and propose new features or problems of the project to my team, so we can embrace challenges for improving customer satisfaction and technical solutions.
