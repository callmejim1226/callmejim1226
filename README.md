# Hi there 👋


I'm a passionate **full-stack software programmer**, who enjoys exploring many fields in computer science. These include web & mobile app development (full-stack), database design, algorithm & data, networks & distributed systems, object-oriented design, and using scripting languages (Java, Python, etc). 

- 🔭 I’m currently developing a full stack Flutter app in the [WiroArt](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wiroart-inc/) and leading the [NEU LIKELION](https://www.instagram.com/likelion_neu) community through [LIKELION US](https://us.likelion.net/) class program at Northeastern University.
- 🏫 I concentrate on software development at Northeastern University as a computer science major and pursuing a math minor. I expect to graduate by December 2024 with a BSCS degree. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development (Web 2.0 & 3.0, mobile app) and computer systems
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with product managers and software developers in a company that makes creative software
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Blockchain (Web 3.0) and Cloud product development
- 💬 Ask me about the CS program at Northeastern University and software development work in a start-up
- 📫 How to reach me: [My Personal Webiste](https://callmejim.netlify.app/)

## [WiroArt](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wiroart-inc/about/) Project
As a head of development in the #1 social networking platform 📱 for fine arts,

- 📊 I direct on NoSQL 20+ social network data models to analyze and store 1K+ artist network data in Google Cloud Platform
- 🧑‍🎨 I contribute to Flutter app with Dart language for 2.6M+ artists to expand the network and promote their 1K+ artworks
- 📂 I manage 4+ developers with Github project documentation to build an interactive remote workplace. The repository is **private** until we release the beta version of the app by the end of 2024.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I take the lead as the opportunity to learn more about the development of software products and become an effective communicator & eager listener when I collaborate with my teammates.
