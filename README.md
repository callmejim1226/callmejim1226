### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a passionate programmer, who enjoys exploring many fields in computer science. These include web development (full-stack), database design, algorithm & data, networks & distributed systems, object-oriented design, and using scripting languages (Java, Python, etc). I'm currently concentrating on the software field at Northeastern University as a computer science major and pursuing a math minor. 

I enjoy experiencing a leadership role in the Northeastern Electric Racing Club and Korean Computer Science Community. I take the lead as the opportunity to learn more about the development of software products and become an effective communicator & eager listener when I collaborate with my teammates.
